    <h1>Shakshuka</h1>
    <p>The following is a recipe for Shakshuka. Shakshuka is a simple dish made of gently poached eggs in a delicious chunky tomato and bell pepper sauce. 
        Said to have originated in Tunisia, this breakfast recipe is popular in many parts of North Africa and the Middle East. It is so satisfying, you can serve it for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Vegetables: 1 large chopped onion, 1 to 2 green bell peppers, and 2 minced garlic cloves. These three ingredients (plus spices) creates a sofrito to start the chunky sauce.</li>
        <li>Spices: coriander, cumin, paprika-- a trio of warm North African flavors. If you like spicy shakshuka (some call it eggs in purgatory), add a pinch of red pepper flakes or cayenne pepper.</li>
        <li>Tomatoes: In this recipe, I use 6 fresh medium-sized tomatoes and about Â½ cup of tomato sauce, this combination gives me the texture and flavor I'm looking for. It helps if your fresh tomatoes are soft and almost overripe. 
            If tomatoes are not in season, you can replace them with 1 28-ounce can of whole tomatoes or 6 cups canned chopped tomatoes with their juices. If you use the canned tomato alternative, you can omit the tomato sauce.</li>
        <li>Eggs: 6 large raw eggs</li>
        <li>Garnish: This is totally optional, but for me a handful of fresh chopped parsley and mint just before serving adds freshness and a pop of color. And if you love your shakshuka with feta, then add a sprinkle of creamy feta cheese just before serving.</li>
    </ul>

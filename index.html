            <h1 class="title">The Mediterranean Diet</h1>
            <p>
                For the last couple of years I have been a big fan of the Mediterran Diet which is 
                primarily found in the Mediterranean region of the world to include <em> Spain </em>, <em> Italy </em>, <em> Greece </em>
                and other countries that border the Mediterranean Sea. The diet consists of plant-based foods, 
                such as whole grains, vegetables, legumes, fruits, nuts, seeds, herbs and spices, as the foundation of the diet.
            </p>

            <h3>What to Eat on The Mediterranean Diet?</h3>
            <p>The list of Mediterranean recipes below should give you a great start! But just for simplicity's sake, here's a very general summary to help you eat the Mediterranean way: </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Eat MORE (every day) leafy greens, vegetables, fruits, whole grains, beans, nuts, and legumes.</li> 
                <li>Eat MODERATELY (weekly) lean proteins from fish, some poultry, and eggs.</li>
                <li>Eat LESS (infrequently) Red Meats and Sweets (sweets are often eliminated if you’re following a stricter Mediterranean diet.</li>
                <li>Use Extra Virgin olive oil regularly.</li>
                <li>Avoid processed foods, too much sugar, and any products with a list of ingredients you don't understand or can't read very well.</li>
            </ul>

                    <p>A quick sheet pan with roasted peppers and onions, we nestle the eggs in and bake for just a few minutes. Great with whole grain bread or challah bread! See the full recipe <a href="./recipes/sheetpanveg.html">here.</a></p>

                    <p>Likely one of my favorite egg dishes, and another winner you can make for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. 
                        Gently poached eggs in a chunky tomato mixture with bell peppers, onions and garlic. See the full recipe <a href="./recipes/shakshuka.html">here.</a></p>

    <!--Ingredients list-->
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Vegetables: 3 bell peppers and 1 red onion</li>
        <li>Spices: cumin, za'atar, alepo pepper</li>
        <li>Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
        <li>6 Eggs</li>
        <li>Diced tomatoes, fresh parsley, and a sprking of feta</li>
    </ul>

    <!--Steps for preparation-->
    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Season the vegetables.</strong> Thinly slice 1 red onion and 1 red, orange, and green bell pepper. Give them all a toss in some EVOO and Mediterranean spices like za'atar, cumin, and sweet Aleppo chili.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake the vegetables.</strong> Spread the sliced vegetables in one layer on a sheet pan and bake in a 400 degrees F heated oven for about 10 to 15 minutes or until the veggies soften a bit. They should be tender, but still have some bite to them.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake the eggs.</strong> Take the sheet pan out of the oven briefly. Crack the eggs and add them in. To do this, carefully make small wells in between the roasted vegetables to drop the eggs into. If you’re worried about breaking the yolks, you can crack each egg into a small dish first, and then gently slide it into the sheet pan. Return the sheet pan to the oven and bake for a few minutes, until the egg whites set. The eggs will be done in 5 to 8 minutes, depending on your preferred doneness. Keep an eye on the eggs after about 4 minutes or so to make sure they don’t overcook.</li>
        <li><strong>Season the eggs and add optional finishing touches.</strong> Season eggs with kosher salt and a sprinkle more za'atar. Then, add 1 diced Roma tomato, a large handful of chopped fresh parsley, and some crumbled feta cheese. Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

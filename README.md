# odin-recipes
Odin-recipes is a website that showcases some of my favorite recipes with descriptive paragraphs and ingredient lists.

Some of the techniques that were leveraged in the creation of this website are the elements for paragraphs <p>, unordered lists <ul>, ordered lists <ol>, the individual list items within the two lists <li>, the anchor tag for links <a>, the <img> tag for images, and the html-boilerplate structure.
